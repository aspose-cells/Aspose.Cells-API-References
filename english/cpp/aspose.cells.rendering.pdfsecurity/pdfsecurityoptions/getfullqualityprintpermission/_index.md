## PdfSecurityOptions::GetFullQualityPrintPermission method


Indicates whether to allow to print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be generated.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Cells::Rendering::PdfSecurity::PdfSecurityOptions::GetFullQualityPrintPermission()
```

## Remarks


When it is clear (and PrintPermission is set), printing is limited to a low level representation of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality.
