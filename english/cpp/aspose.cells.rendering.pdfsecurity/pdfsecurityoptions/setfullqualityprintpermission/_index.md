## PdfSecurityOptions::SetFullQualityPrintPermission method


Indicates whether to allow to print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be generated.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Rendering::PdfSecurity::PdfSecurityOptions::SetFullQualityPrintPermission(bool value)
```

## Remarks


When it is clear (and PrintPermission is set), printing is limited to a low level representation of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality.
