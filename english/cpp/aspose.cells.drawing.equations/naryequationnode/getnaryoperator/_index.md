## NaryEquationNode::GetNaryOperator method


an n-ary operator.e.g "∑". It is strongly recommended to use attribute NaryOperatorType to set n-ary operator. Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type.

```cpp
U16String Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::GetNaryOperator()
```

## Remarks


It should be noted that this property only accepts one character, and if multiple characters are passed in, only the first character is accepted.
