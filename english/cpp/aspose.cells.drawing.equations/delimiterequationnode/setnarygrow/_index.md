## DelimiterEquationNode::SetNaryGrow method


Specifies whether the delimiter should automatically expand and contract with the height of the formula.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::DelimiterEquationNode::SetNaryGrow(bool value)
```

## Remarks


This property specifies the growth property of the delimiter at the document level. When off, the delimiter will not grow to match the size of its component height. When enabled, the delimiter grows vertically to match its component height.
