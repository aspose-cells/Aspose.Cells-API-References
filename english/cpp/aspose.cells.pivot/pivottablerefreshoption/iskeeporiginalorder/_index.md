Indicates whether to keep pivot items' original order as old data source.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Cells::Pivot::PivotTableRefreshOption::IsKeepOriginalOrder()
```

Only applicable for the pivot field which is not sorted. When refreshing such kind of pivot field, Ms Excel keeps the original order of old data source.

If user needs the pivot field to be refreshed completely as the data in the new data source, this property should be set as false.
