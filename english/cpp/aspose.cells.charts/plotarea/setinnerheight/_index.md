## PlotArea::SetInnerHeight method


Gets or sets the height of plot area in units of 1/4000 of the chart area.


>Deprecated
>
>Use PlotArea.InnerHeightRatioToChart property, instead. 
```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Charts::PlotArea::SetInnerHeight(int32_t value)
```

## Remarks


The plot-area bounding box includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If the value is not created by MS Excel, please call [Chart.Calculate()](../../chart/calculate/) method before calling this method. 

The **X**, **Y**, **Width** and **Height** of **[PlotArea](../)** represents the plot-area bounding box that includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If you want to get actual size of plot area, you should call **InnerXRatioToChart**, **InnerYRatioToChart**, **InnerWidthRatioToChart** and **InnerHeightRatioToChart** properties.

For excel 2007 or latter, the default value is zero. you should call get the value after calling [Chart.Calculate()](../../chart/calculate/).

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use PlotArea.InnerHeightRatioToChart property, instead. InnerHeight = InnerHeightRatioToChart * 4000; This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. **Aspose** apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
