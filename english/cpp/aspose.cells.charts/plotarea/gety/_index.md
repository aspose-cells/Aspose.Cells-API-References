The plot-area bounding box includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If the value is not created by MS Excel, please call [Chart.Calculate()](../../chart/calculate/) method before calling this method. 

The **X**, **Y**, **Width** and **Height** of **[PlotArea](../)** represents the plot-area bounding box that includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If you want to get actual size of plot area, you should call **InnerX**, **InnerY**, **InnerWidth** and **InnerHeight** properties.
