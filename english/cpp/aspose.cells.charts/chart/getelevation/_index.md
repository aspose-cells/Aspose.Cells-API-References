## Chart::GetElevation method


Represents the elevation of the 3-D chart view, in degrees.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Charts::Chart::GetElevation()
```

## Remarks


The chart elevation is the height at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.
