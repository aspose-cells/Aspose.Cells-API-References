## Chart::SetElevation method


Represents the elevation of the 3-D chart view, in degrees.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Charts::Chart::SetElevation(int32_t value)
```

## Remarks


The chart elevation is the height at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.
