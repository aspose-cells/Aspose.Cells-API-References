## ChartFrame::SetHeight method


Gets or sets the height of frame in units of 1/4000 of the chart area.


>Deprecated
>
>Use ChartFrame.HeightRatioToChart property, instead. 
```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartFrame::SetHeight(int32_t value)
```

## Remarks


How to convert units of 1/4000 to pixels? Height In Pixels = Y * Chart.ChartObject.Height / 4000d; 

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use ChartFrame.HeightRatioToChart property, instead. Height = HeightRatioToChart * 4000. This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. **Aspose** apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
