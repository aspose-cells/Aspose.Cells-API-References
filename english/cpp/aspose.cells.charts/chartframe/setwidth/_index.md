## ChartFrame::SetWidth method


Gets or sets the width of frame in units of 1/4000 of the chart area.


>Deprecated
>
>Use ChartFrame.WidthRatioToChart property, instead. 
```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartFrame::SetWidth(int32_t value)
```

## Remarks


How to convert units of 1/4000 to pixels? Width In Pixels = Width * Chart.ChartObject.Height / 4000d; 

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use ChartFrame.WidthRatioToChart property, instead. Width = WidthRatioToChart * 4000; This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. **Aspose** apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
