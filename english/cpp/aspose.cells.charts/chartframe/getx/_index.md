## ChartFrame::GetX method


Gets or sets the x coordinate of the upper left corner in units of 1/4000 of the chart area.


>Deprecated
>
>Use ChartFrame.XRatioToChart property, instead. 
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartFrame::GetX()
```

## Remarks


How to convert units of 1/4000 to pixels? X In Pixels = X * Chart.ChartObject.Width / 4000d; 

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use ChartFrame.XRatioToChart property, instead. X = XRatioToChart * 4000. This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. **Aspose** apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
