## ImageOrPrintOptions::GetEmfRenderSetting method


Setting for rendering Emf metafiles in source file.

```cpp
EmfRenderSetting Aspose::Cells::Rendering::ImageOrPrintOptions::GetEmfRenderSetting()
```

## Remarks


EMF metafiles identified as "EMF+ Dual" can contain both EMF+ records and EMF records. Either type of record can be used to render the image, only EMF+ records, or only EMF records. When [Aspose.Cells.EmfRenderSetting.EmfPlusPrefer](../../../aspose.cells/emfrendersetting/) is set, then EMF+ records will be parsed while rendering to image, otherwise only EMF records will be parsed. Default value is [Aspose.Cells.EmfRenderSetting.EmfOnly](../../../aspose.cells/emfrendersetting/). For the frameworks that depend on .Net System.Drawing.Common, this setting is ignored.
