## Cells::GetMinRow method


Minimum row index of cell which contains data or style.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinRow()
```

## Remarks


This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
