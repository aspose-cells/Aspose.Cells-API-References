## Cells::GetMaxDataColumn method


Maximum column index of cell which contains data.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxDataColumn()
```

## Remarks


-1 will be returned if there is no cell which contains data. This property needs to iterate and check all cells in a worksheet, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly.
