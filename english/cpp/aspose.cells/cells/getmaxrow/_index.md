## Cells::GetMaxRow method


Maximum row index of cell which contains data or style.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxRow()
```

## Remarks


Return -1 if there is no cell which contains data or style in the worksheet. This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
