## U16String::IndexOfAny(const Vector \<char16_t\>\&) const method


Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence in this instance of any character in a specified array of characters.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::U16String::IndexOfAny(const Vector<char16_t> &anyOf) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| anyOf | const Vector \<char16_t\>\& | A character array containing one or more characters to seek. |

## ReturnValue

The zero-based index position of the first occurrence in this instance where any character in anyOf was found; -1 if no character in anyOf was found.
