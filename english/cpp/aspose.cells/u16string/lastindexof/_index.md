## U16String::LastIndexOf(const char16_t) const method


Returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in this.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::U16String::LastIndexOf(const char16_t value) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | const char16_t | To be searched. |

## ReturnValue

The zero-based index position of value if that character is found, or -1 if it is not.

## U16String::LastIndexOf(const char16_t, int32_t) const method


Returns the index of the last occurrence of the value in this.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::U16String::LastIndexOf(const char16_t value, int32_t startIndex) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | const char16_t | To be searched. |
| startIndex | int32_t | The search starting position. The search proceeds from startIndex toward the beginning of this instance. |

## ReturnValue
