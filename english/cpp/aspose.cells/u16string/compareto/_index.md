int32_t Aspose::Cells::U16String::CompareTo(const U16String &value) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | const U16String\& | The string to compare with this instance. |

## ReturnValue

A 32-bit signed integer that indicates the lexical relationship between the two comparands. -1: this instance precedes value in the sort order. 0: this instance occurs in the same position as value in the sort order. > 0: this instance follows value in the sort order.
