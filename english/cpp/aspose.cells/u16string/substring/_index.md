## U16String::Substring(int32_t) const method


Retrieves a substring from this instance. The substring starts at a specified character position and continues to the end of the string.

```cpp
U16String Aspose::Cells::U16String::Substring(int32_t startIndex) const
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startIndex | int32_t | The zero-based starting character position of a substring in this instance. |

## ReturnValue

A string that is equivalent to the substring that begins at startIndex in this instance, or Empty if startIndex is equal to the length of this instance.
