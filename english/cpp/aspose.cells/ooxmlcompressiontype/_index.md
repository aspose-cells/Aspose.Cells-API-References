## OoxmlCompressionType enum


The Ooxml compression type.

```cpp
enum class OoxmlCompressionType
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level1 | 1 | The fastest but least effective compression. |
| Level2 | 2 | A little slower, but better, than level 1. |
| Level3 | 3 | A little slower, but better, than level 2. |
| Level4 | 4 | A little slower, but better, than level 3. |
| Level5 | 5 | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. |
| Level6 | 6 | A good balance of speed and compression efficiency. |
| Level7 | 7 | Pretty good compression! |
| Level8 | 8 | Better compression than Level7! |
| Level9 | 9 | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. This is also the slowest compression. |
