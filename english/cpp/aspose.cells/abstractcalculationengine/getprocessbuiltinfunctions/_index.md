## AbstractCalculationEngine::GetProcessBuiltInFunctions method


Whether built-in functions that have been supported by the built-in engine should be checked and processed by this implementation. Default is false.

```cpp
virtual bool Aspose::Cells::AbstractCalculationEngine::GetProcessBuiltInFunctions()
```

## Remarks


If user needs to change the calculation logic of some built-in functions, this property should be set as true. Otherwise please leave this property as false for performance consideration.
