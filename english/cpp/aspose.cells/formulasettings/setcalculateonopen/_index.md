## FormulaSettings::SetCalculateOnOpen method


Indicates whether the application is required to perform a full calculation when the workbook is opened.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::FormulaSettings::SetCalculateOnOpen(bool value)
```

## Remarks


This property is only for saving the settings to resultant spreadsheet file so that other applications(such as ms excel) may act accordingly when loading the resultant file. For performance consideration for most users' applications, we do not calculate any formula in the workbook automatically, no matter what value has been set for this property.
