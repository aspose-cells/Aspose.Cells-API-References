## Worksheet::GetCustomProperties method


Gets an object representing the identifier information associated with a worksheet.

```cpp
CustomPropertyCollection Aspose::Cells::Worksheet::GetCustomProperties()

## Remarks


Worksheet.CustomProperties provide a preferred mechanism for storing arbitrary data. It supports legacy third-party document components, as well as those situations that have a stringent need for binary parts.
