## Validation::AddArea(const CellArea\&) method


Applies the validation to the area.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Validation::AddArea(const CellArea &cellArea)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cellArea | const CellArea\& | The area. |
## Remarks



It is equivalent to use AddArea(Aspose.Cells.CellArea,bool,bool) with checking intersection and edge.

## Validation::AddArea(const CellArea\&, bool, bool) method


Applies the validation to the area.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Validation::AddArea(const CellArea &cellArea, bool checkIntersection, bool checkEdge)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cellArea | const CellArea\& | The area. |
| checkIntersection | bool | Whether check the intersection of given area with existing validations' areas. If one validation has been applied in given area(or part of it), then the existing validation should be removed at first from given area. Otherwise corruption may be caused for the generated Validations. If user is sure that the added area does not intersect with any existing area, this parameter can be set as false for performance consideration. |
| checkEdge | bool | Whether check the edge of this validation's applied areas. [Validation](../)'s internal settings depend on the top-left one of its applied ranges, so if given area will become the new top-left one of the applied ranges, the internal settings should be changed and rebuilt, otherwise unexpected result may be caused. If user is sure that the added area is not the top-left one, this parameter can be set as false for performance consideration. |
## Remarks



In this method, we will remove all old validations in given area. For the top-left one of [Validation](../)'s applied ranges, firstly its StartRow is smallest, secondly its StartColumn is the smallest one of those areas who have the same smallest StartRow.
