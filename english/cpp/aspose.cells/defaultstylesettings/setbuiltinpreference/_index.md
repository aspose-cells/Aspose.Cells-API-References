## DefaultStyleSettings::SetBuiltInPreference method


Indicates whether property for number format is preferrable when the style defines both built-in number and custom pattern. Default value is false, that means by default custom pattern will be used to format values as long as it is not empty for one style.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::DefaultStyleSettings::SetBuiltInPreference(bool value)
```

## Remarks


When loading workbook from existing template file, maybe both built-in number and custom pattern are defined for one style. This property determine whether we should use the built-in number or the custom pattern when formatting values with the style.
