```cpp
class Top10Filter
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetCriteria()](./getcriteria/) |  **(Deprecated)** The actual cell value in the range which is used to perform the comparison for this filter. This is the cache value during the refresh process. |
| [GetItems()](./getitems/) | Gets and sets top or bottom value to use as the filter criteria. |
| [IsNull()](./isnull/) const | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. |
| [IsPercent()](./ispercent/) | Indicates whether or not to filter by percent value of the column. |
| [IsTop()](./istop/) | Indicates whether or not to filter by top order. |
| explicit [operator bool()](./operator_bool/) const | operator bool() |
| [operator=(const Top10Filter\& src)](./operator_asm/) | operator= |
| [SetCriteria(const Aspose::Cells::Object\& value)](./setcriteria/) |  **(Deprecated)** The actual cell value in the range which is used to perform the comparison for this filter. This is the cache value during the refresh process. |
| [SetIsPercent(bool value)](./setispercent/) | Indicates whether or not to filter by percent value of the column. |
| [SetIsTop(bool value)](./setistop/) | Indicates whether or not to filter by top order. |
| [SetItems(int32_t value)](./setitems/) | Gets and sets top or bottom value to use as the filter criteria. |
| [ToObject()](./toobject/) | Gets the [Object](../object/). |
| [Top10Filter(Top10Filter_Impl* impl)](./top10filter/) | Constructs from an implementation object. |
| [Top10Filter(const Aspose::Cells::Object\& obj)](./top10filter/) | Constructs from an [Object](../object/) convertible to this. |
| [Top10Filter(const Top10Filter\& src)](./top10filter/) | Copy constructor. |
| [~Top10Filter()](./~top10filter/) | Destructor. |
