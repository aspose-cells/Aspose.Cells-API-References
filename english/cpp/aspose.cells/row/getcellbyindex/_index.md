## Row::GetCellByIndex method


Get the cell by specific index in the cells collection of this row.

```cpp
Cell Aspose::Cells::Row::GetCellByIndex(int32_t index)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| index | int32_t | The index(position) of the cell in the cells collection of this row. |

## ReturnValue

The [Cell](../../cell/) object at given position.
## Remarks



To traverse all cells in sequence without modification, using [GetEnumerator()](../getenumerator/) will give better performance than using this method to get cell one by one.
