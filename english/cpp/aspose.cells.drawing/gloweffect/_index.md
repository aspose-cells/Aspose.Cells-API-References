```cpp
class GlowEffect
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetColor()](./getcolor/) | Gets the color of the glow effect. |
| [GetSize()](./getsize/) | Gets and sets the radius of the glow, in unit of points. |
| [GetTransparency()](./gettransparency/) | Gets and sets the degree of transparency of the glow effect. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0.0 (opaque) to 1.0 (clear). |
| [GlowEffect(GlowEffect_Impl* impl)](./gloweffect/) | Constructs from an implementation object. |
| [GlowEffect(const GlowEffect\& src)](./gloweffect/) | Copy constructor. |
| [IsNull()](./isnull/) const | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. |
| explicit [operator bool()](./operator_bool/) const | operator bool() |
| [operator=(const GlowEffect\& src)](./operator_asm/) | operator= |
| [SetColor(const CellsColor\& value)](./setcolor/) | Gets the color of the glow effect. |
| [SetSize(double value)](./setsize/) | Gets and sets the radius of the glow, in unit of points. |
| [SetTransparency(double value)](./settransparency/) | Gets and sets the degree of transparency of the glow effect. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0.0 (opaque) to 1.0 (clear). |
