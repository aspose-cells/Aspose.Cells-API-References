## ShapePath::CubicBezierTo method


Appends a cubic Bézier curve to the current figure. The starting point is the end point of the current figure.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePath::CubicBezierTo(float ctrX1, float ctrY1, float ctrX2, float ctrY2, float endX, float endY)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ctrX1 | float | The x-coordinate of the first control point for the curve. |
| ctrY1 | float | The y-coordinate of the first control point for the curve. |
| ctrX2 | float | The x-coordinate of the second control point for the curve. |
| ctrY2 | float | The y-coordinate of the second control point for the curve. |
| endX | float | The x-coordinate of the endpoint of the curve. |
| endY | float | The y-coordinate of the endpoint of the curve. |
