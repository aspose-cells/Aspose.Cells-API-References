## ShapePath::ArcTo method


Appends an elliptical arc to the current figure. The starting point is the end point of the current figure.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePath::ArcTo(float wR, float hR, float stAng, float swAng)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wR | float | The half-width of the rectangular area of ​​the ellipse that draws the arc(Unit: Pixel). |
| hR | float | The half-height of the rectangular area of ​​the ellipse that draws the arc(Unit: Pixel). |
| stAng | float | The starting angle of the arc, measured in degrees clockwise from the x-axis(Unit: Degree). |
| swAng | float | The angle between startAngle and the end of the arc.(Unit: Degree) |
