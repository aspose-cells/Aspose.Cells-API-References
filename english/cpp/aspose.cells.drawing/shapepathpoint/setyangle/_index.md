## ShapePathPoint::SetYAngle method


When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees.

```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePathPoint::SetYAngle(int32_t value)
```

## Remarks


If this angle is the swing angle of an arc. This angle will specify how far angle-wise along the supposed cicle path the arc will be extended. The extension from the start angle will always be in the clockwise direction around the supposed circle.
