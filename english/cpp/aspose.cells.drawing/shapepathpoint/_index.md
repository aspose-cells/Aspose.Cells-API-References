## ShapePathPoint class


Represents an x-y coordinate within the path coordinate space.

```cpp
class ShapePathPoint
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetX()](./getx/) | Gets and sets x coordinate for this position coordinate. |
| [GetY()](./gety/) | Gets y coordinate for this position coordinate. |
| [IsNull()](./isnull/) const | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. |
| explicit [operator bool()](./operator_bool/) const | operator bool() |
| [operator=(const ShapePathPoint\& src)](./operator_asm/) | operator= |
| [SetX(int32_t value)](./setx/) | Gets and sets x coordinate for this position coordinate. |
| [SetY(int32_t value)](./sety/) | Gets y coordinate for this position coordinate. |
| [ShapePathPoint(ShapePathPoint_Impl* impl)](./shapepathpoint/) | Constructs from an implementation object. |
| [ShapePathPoint(const ShapePathPoint\& src)](./shapepathpoint/) | Copy constructor. |
