## ShapeCollection::AddActiveXControl method


Creates an Activex Control.

```cpp
Shape Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapeCollection::AddActiveXControl(ControlType type, int32_t topRow, int32_t top, int32_t leftColumn, int32_t left, int32_t width, int32_t height)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | ControlType | The type of the control. |
| topRow | int32_t | Upper left row index. |
| top | int32_t | Represents the vertical offset of [Shape](../../shape/) from its left row, in unit of pixel. |
| leftColumn | int32_t | Upper left column index. |
| left | int32_t | Represents the horizontal offset of [Shape](../../shape/) from its left column, in unit of pixel. |
| height | int32_t | Represents the height of [Shape](../../shape/), in unit of pixel. |
| width | int32_t | Represents the width of [Shape](../../shape/), in unit of pixel. |
