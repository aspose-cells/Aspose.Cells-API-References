## ShapeCollection::AddArc method


Adds a [ArcShape](../../arcshape/) to the worksheet.

```cpp
ArcShape Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapeCollection::AddArc(int32_t upperLeftRow, int32_t top, int32_t upperLeftColumn, int32_t left, int32_t height, int32_t width)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upperLeftRow | int32_t | Upper left row index. |
| top | int32_t | Represents the vertical offset of [ArcShape](../../arcshape/) from its left row, in unit of pixel. |
| upperLeftColumn | int32_t | Upper left column index. |
| left | int32_t | Represents the horizontal offset of [ArcShape](../../arcshape/) from its left column, in unit of pixel. |
| height | int32_t | Represents the height of [ArcShape](../../arcshape/), in unit of pixel. |
| width | int32_t | Represents the width of [ArcShape](../../arcshape/), in unit of pixel. |

## ReturnValue

A [ArcShape](../../arcshape/) object.


## Examples


```cpp
    //add a arc
ArcShape arcShape = shapes.AddArc(1, 0, 1, 0, 100, 50);
```
