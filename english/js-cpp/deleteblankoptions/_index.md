### constructor(DeleteOptions) {#constructor-deleteoptions-}

Constructs from a parent object convertible to this.

```javascript
constructor(obj: DeleteOptions);
```

**Parameters:**

### mergedCellsShrinkType {#mergedCellsShrinkType--}

Indicates how to process merged cells when deleting blank rows/columns.

```javascript
mergedCellsShrinkType : MergedCellsShrinkType;
```


**Remarks**

For [MergedCellsShrinkType.KeepHeaderOnly](../mergedcellsshrinktype.keepheaderonly/), all cells in it will be taken as blank except the non-blank top-left cell. It is the default value of this property.<br></br> For [MergedCellsShrinkType.None](../mergedcellsshrinktype.none/), all cells in it will be taken as non-blank.<br></br> For [MergedCellsShrinkType.ShrinkToFit](../mergedcellsshrinktype.shrinktofit/), all cells outside the content display area will be taken as blank.<br></br

### startIndex {#startIndex--}

Specifies the start row/column index of the range to check and delete blank rows/columns.

```javascript
startIndex : number;
```


### endIndex {#endIndex--}

Specifies the end row/column index(inclusive) of the range to check and delete blank rows/columns. Default value is -1 and -1 means the maximum range of all objects(cells, drawings, ...) that need to be checked.

```javascript
endIndex : number;
```


### updateReference {#updateReference--}

Indicates if update references in other worksheets.

```javascript
updateReference : boolean;
```


### formulaChangeMonitor {#formulaChangeMonitor--}

Gets/sets the monitor for tracking changes caused by the deletion.

```javascript
formulaChangeMonitor : AbstractFormulaChangeMonitor;
```
