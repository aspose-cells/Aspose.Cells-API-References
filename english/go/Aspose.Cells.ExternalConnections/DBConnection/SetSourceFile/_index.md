## SetSourceFile function

Used when the external data source is file-based. When a connection to such a datasource fails, the spreadsheet application attempts to connect directly to this file. May beexpressed in URI or system-specific file path notation.

```go

func (instance *DBConnection) SetSourceFile_String(value string)  error

```
