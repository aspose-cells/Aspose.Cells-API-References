## AbstractFormulaChangeMonitor class

Monitor for user to track the change of formulas during certain operations.

```javascript
abstract class AbstractFormulaChangeMonitor;
```

### Remarks
For example, while deleting/inserting range of cells, formulas of other cells may be changed because of the shift of references. Please note, methods in the monitor may be invoked multiple times for one object which contains the formula.
