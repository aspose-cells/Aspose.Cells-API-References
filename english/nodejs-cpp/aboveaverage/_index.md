```javascript
class AboveAverage;
```


## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [constructor()](#constructor--)| Default Constructor. |

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [isAboveAverage](#isAboveAverage--)| boolean | Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true. |
| [isEqualAverage](#isEqualAverage--)| boolean | Get or set the flag indicating whether the 'aboveAverage' and 'belowAverage' criteria is inclusive of the average itself, or exclusive of that value. 'true' indicates to include the average value in the criteria. Default value is false. |
| [stdDev](#stdDev--)| number | Get or set the number of standard deviations to include above or below the average in the conditional formatting rule. The input value must between 0 and 3 (include 0 and 3). Setting this value to 0 means stdDev is not set. The default value is 0. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [isAboveAverage()](#isAboveAverage--)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isAboveAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true. |
| [setIsAboveAverage(boolean)](#setIsAboveAverage-boolean-)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isAboveAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true. |
| [isEqualAverage()](#isEqualAverage--)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isEqualAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the 'aboveAverage' and 'belowAverage' criteria is inclusive of the average itself, or exclusive of that value. 'true' indicates to include the average value in the criteria. Default value is false. |
| [setIsEqualAverage(boolean)](#setIsEqualAverage-boolean-)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isEqualAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the 'aboveAverage' and 'belowAverage' criteria is inclusive of the average itself, or exclusive of that value. 'true' indicates to include the average value in the criteria. Default value is false. |
| [getStdDev()](#getStdDev--)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'stdDev' property instead. Get or set the number of standard deviations to include above or below the average in the conditional formatting rule. The input value must between 0 and 3 (include 0 and 3). Setting this value to 0 means stdDev is not set. The default value is 0. |
| [setStdDev(number)](#setStdDev-number-)| <b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'stdDev' property instead. Get or set the number of standard deviations to include above or below the average in the conditional formatting rule. The input value must between 0 and 3 (include 0 and 3). Setting this value to 0 means stdDev is not set. The default value is 0. |

### constructor() {#constructor--}

Default Constructor.

```javascript
constructor();
```


### isAboveAverage {#isAboveAverage--}

Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true.

```javascript
isAboveAverage : boolean;
```


### isEqualAverage {#isEqualAverage--}

Get or set the flag indicating whether the 'aboveAverage' and 'belowAverage' criteria is inclusive of the average itself, or exclusive of that value. 'true' indicates to include the average value in the criteria. Default value is false.

```javascript
isEqualAverage : boolean;
```


### stdDev {#stdDev--}

Get or set the number of standard deviations to include above or below the average in the conditional formatting rule. The input value must between 0 and 3 (include 0 and 3). Setting this value to 0 means stdDev is not set. The default value is 0.

```javascript
stdDev : number;
```


### isAboveAverage() {#isAboveAverage--}

<b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isAboveAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true.

```javascript
isAboveAverage() : boolean;
```


### setIsAboveAverage(boolean) {#setIsAboveAverage-boolean-}

<b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isAboveAverage' property instead. Get or set the flag indicating whether the rule is an "above average" rule. 'true' indicates 'above average'. Default value is true.

```javascript
setIsAboveAverage(value: boolean) : void;
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | boolean | The value to set. |

### isEqualAverage() {#isEqualAverage--}

<b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isEqualAverage' property instead.

'true' indicates to include the average value in the criteria. Default value is false.

```javascript
isEqualAverage() : boolean;
```


### setIsEqualAverage(boolean) {#setIsEqualAverage-boolean-}

<b>@deprecated.</b> Please use the 'isEqualAverage' property instead.
