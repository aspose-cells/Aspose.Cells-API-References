## SetSecondCommand function

Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-basedpage fields are in use.For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (noWHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed

```go

func (instance *WebQueryConnection) SetSecondCommand(value string)  error

```
