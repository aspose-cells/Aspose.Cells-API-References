|[NewTrendline](./newtrendline/) | Constructs from a parent object. | 

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[IsNull](./isnull/) | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. | 
|[IsNameAuto](./isnameauto/) | Returns if Microsoft Excel automatically determines the name of the trendline. | 
|[SetIsNameAuto](./setisnameauto/) | Returns if Microsoft Excel automatically determines the name of the trendline. | 
|[GetType](./gettype/) | Returns the trendline type. | 
|[GetName](./getname/) | Returns the name of the trendline. | 
|[SetName](./setname/) | Returns the name of the trendline. | 
|[GetOrder](./getorder/) | Returns or sets the trendline order (an integer greater than 1) when the trendline type is Polynomial.The order must be between 2 and 6. | 
|[SetOrder](./setorder/) | Returns or sets the trendline order (an integer greater than 1) when the trendline type is Polynomial.The order must be between 2 and 6. | 
|[GetPeriod](./getperiod/) | Returns or sets the period for the moving-average trendline. | 
|[SetPeriod](./setperiod/) | Returns or sets the period for the moving-average trendline. | 
|[GetForward](./getforward/) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends forward.The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero. | 
|[SetForward](./setforward/) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends forward.The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero. | 
|[GetBackward](./getbackward/) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends backward.The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero.If the chart type is column ,the number of periods must be between 0 and 0.5 | 
|[SetBackward](./setbackward/) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends backward.The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero.If the chart type is column ,the number of periods must be between 0 and 0.5 | 
|[GetDisplayEquation](./getdisplayequation/) | Represents if the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the R-squared value). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. | 
|[SetDisplayEquation](./setdisplayequation/) | Represents if the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the R-squared value). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. | 
|[GetDisplayRSquared](./getdisplayrsquared/) | Represents if the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the equation). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. | 
|[SetDisplayRSquared](./setdisplayrsquared/) | Represents if the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the equation). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. | 
|[GetIntercept](./getintercept/) | Returns or sets the point where the trendline crosses the value axis. | 
|[SetIntercept](./setintercept/) | Returns or sets the point where the trendline crosses the value axis. | 
|[GetDataLabels](./getdatalabels/) | Represents the DataLabels object for the specified series. | 
|[GetLegendEntry](./getlegendentry/) | Gets the legend entry according to this trendline | 
|[GetCompoundType](./getcompoundtype/) | Specifies the compound line type |

|[GetDashType](./getdashtype/) | Specifies the dash line type | 
|[SetDashType](./setdashtype/) | Specifies the dash line type | 
|[GetCapType](./getcaptype/) | Specifies the ending caps. | 
|[SetCapType](./setcaptype/) | Specifies the ending caps. | 
|[GetJoinType](./getjointype/) | Specifies the joining caps. |
