## SetNaryGrow function

This attribute specifies the growth property of n-ary operators at the document level. When off, n-ary operators such as integrals and summations do not grow to match the size of their operand height. When on, the n-ary operator grows vertically to match its operand height.

```go

func (instance *NaryEquationNode) SetNaryGrow(value bool)  error

```
