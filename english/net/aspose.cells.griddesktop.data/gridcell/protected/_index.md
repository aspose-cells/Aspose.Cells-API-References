## GridCell.Protected property

Indicates if the cell is protected. If the value is "true", user can not modify the cell through the user interface. This attribute has nothing to do with the Style.CellLocked property and will not be saved to file when grid data exported. The default value is "false".

```csharp
public bool Protected { get; set; }
```
