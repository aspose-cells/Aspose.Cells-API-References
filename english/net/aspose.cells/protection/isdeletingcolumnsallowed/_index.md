## Protection.IsDeletingColumnsAllowed property

Represents if the deletion of columns is allowed on a protected worksheet.

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use Protection.AllowDeletingColumn property instead.")]
[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public bool IsDeletingColumnsAllowed { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The columns containing the cells to be deleted must be unlocked when the sheet is protected, and "Select unlocked cells" option must be enabled.

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Instead, please use Protection.AllowDeletingColumn property. This property will be removed 12 months later since June 2010. Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
