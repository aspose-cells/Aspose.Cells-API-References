## Protection.IsDeletingRowsAllowed property

Represents if the deletion of rows is allowed on a protected worksheet.

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use Protection.AllowDeletingRow property instead.")]
[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public bool IsDeletingRowsAllowed { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The rows containing the cells to be deleted must be unlocked when the sheet is protected, and "Select unlocked cells" option must be enabled.

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Instead, please use Protection.AllowDeletingRow property. This property will be removed 12 months later since June 2010. Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
