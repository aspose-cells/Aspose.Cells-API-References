## FormatCondition.Formula1 property

Gets and sets the value or expression associated with conditional formatting.

```csharp
public string Formula1 { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Please add all areas before setting formula. For setting formula for this condition, if the input value starts with '=', then it will be taken as formula. Otherwise it will be taken as plain value(text, number, bool). For text value that starts with '=', user may input it as formula in format: "=\"=...\"".
