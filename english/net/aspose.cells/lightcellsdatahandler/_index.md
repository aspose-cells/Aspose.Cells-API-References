## LightCellsDataHandler interface

Represents cells data handler for reading large spreadsheet files in light weight mode.

```csharp
public interface LightCellsDataHandler
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ProcessCell](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdatahandler/processcell)(Cell) | Starts to process one cell. |
| [ProcessRow](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdatahandler/processrow)(Row) | Starts to process one row. |
| [StartCell](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdatahandler/startcell)(int) | Prepares to process a cell. |
| [StartRow](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdatahandler/startrow)(int) | Prepares to process a row. |
| [StartSheet](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdatahandler/startsheet)(Worksheet) | Starts to process a worksheet. |

### Remarks

When reading a workbook by this mode, [`StartSheet`](./startsheet) will be checked when reading every worksheet in the workbook. For one sheet, if [`StartSheet`](./startsheet) gives true, then all data and properties of rows/cells of this sheet will be checked and processed by the implementation of this interface. For every row, [`StartRow`](./startrow) will be called to check whether it need to be processed. If a row needs to be processed, properties of this row will be read firstly and user can access its properties by [`ProcessRow`](./processrow). if row's cells need to be processed too, then [`ProcessRow`](./processrow) should returns true and then [`StartCell`](./startcell) will be called for every existing cell in this row to check whether one cell need to be processed. If one cell needs to be processed, then [`ProcessCell`](./processcell) will be called to process the cell by the implementation of this interface.
