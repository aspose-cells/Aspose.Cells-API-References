## LightCellsDataProvider interface

Represents Data provider for saving large spreadsheet files in light weight mode.

```csharp
public interface LightCellsDataProvider
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsGatherString](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/isgatherstring)() | Checks whether the current string value of cell needs to be gathered into a global pool. |
| [NextCell](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/nextcell)() | Gets next cell to be saved. |
| [NextRow](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/nextrow)() | Gets the next row to be saved. |
| [StartCell](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/startcell)(Cell) | Starts to save data of one cell. |
| [StartRow](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/startrow)(Row) | Starts to save data of one row. |
| [StartSheet](../../aspose.cells/lightcellsdataprovider/startsheet)(int) | Starts to save a worksheet. |

### Remarks

When saving a workbook by this mode, [`StartSheet`](./startsheet) will be checked when saving every worksheet in the workbook. For one sheet, if [`StartSheet`](./startsheet) gives true, then all data and properties of rows/cells of this sheet to be saved will be provided by the implementation of this interface. In the first place, [`NextRow`](./nextrow) will be called to get the next row index to be saved. If a valid row index is returned(the row index must be in ascending order for the rows to be saved), then a Row object representing this row will be provided for implementation to set its properties by [`StartRow`](./startrow). For one row, [`NextCell`](./nextcell) will be checked firstly. If a valid column index be returned(the column index must be in ascending order for all cells of one row to be saved), then a Cell object representing this cell will be provided for implementation to set its data and properties by [`StartCell`](./startcell). After data of this cell is set, this cell will be saved directly to the generated spreadsheet file and the next cell will be checked and processed.
