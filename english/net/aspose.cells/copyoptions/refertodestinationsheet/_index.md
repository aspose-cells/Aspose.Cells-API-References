## CopyOptions.ReferToDestinationSheet property

When copying the range in the same file and the chart refers to the source sheet, False means the copied chart's data source will not be changed. True means the copied chart's data source refers to the destination sheet.

```csharp
public bool ReferToDestinationSheet { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is false, it works as MS Excel.
