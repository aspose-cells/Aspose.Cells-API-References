public enum MemorySetting
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | `0` | Default option for cells model. |
| MemoryPreference | `1` | Memory performance preferrable. With this option the data will be held in compact format so for common scenarios it may give lower memory cost. However, this option also may degrade R/W performance a bit in some special cases. |
