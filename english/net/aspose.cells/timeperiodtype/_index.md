    using System;

    public class TimePeriodTypeDemo
    {
        public static void TimePeriodTypeExample()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add a conditional formatting rule
            int index = worksheet.ConditionalFormattings.Add();
            FormatConditionCollection fcs = worksheet.ConditionalFormattings[index];

            // Define the cell area for the conditional formatting
            CellArea ca = new CellArea { StartRow = 0, EndRow = 10, StartColumn = 0, EndColumn = 10 };
            fcs.AddArea(ca);

            // Add a condition for the time period
            int conditionIndex = fcs.AddCondition(FormatConditionType.TimePeriod);
            FormatCondition fc = fcs[conditionIndex];
            fc.Style.BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.LightBlue;

            // Set the time period type
            fc.TimePeriod = TimePeriodType.Today;

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("TimePeriodTypeExample.xlsx");

            return;
