## PdfSaveOptions.EmfRenderSetting property

Setting for rendering Emf metafile.

```csharp
public EmfRenderSetting EmfRenderSetting { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

EMF metafiles identified as "EMF+ Dual" can contain both EMF+ records and EMF records. Either type of record can be used to render the image, only EMF+ records, or only EMF records. When !:EmfRenderSetting.EmfPlusPrefer is set, then EMF+ records will be parsed while rendering to pdf, otherwise only EMF records will be parsed. Default value is !:EmfRenderSetting.EmfOnly.
