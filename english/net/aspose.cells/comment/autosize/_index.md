## Comment.AutoSize property

Indicates if size of comment is adjusted automatically according to its content. Note: In some special cases (such as Mac environment), this setting may not take effect. If this setting does not take effect, please replace it with FitToTextSize().

```csharp
public bool AutoSize { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class CommentPropertyAutoSizeDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add a comment to cell A1
            int commentIndex = worksheet.Comments.Add("A1");
            Comment comment = worksheet.Comments[commentIndex];
            comment.Note = "This is a sample comment that will auto-size to fit its content.";

            // Set AutoSize to true
            comment.AutoSize = true;

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("CommentAutoSizeDemo.xlsx");
        }
    }
}
```
