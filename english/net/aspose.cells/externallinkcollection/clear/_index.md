## ExternalLinkCollection.Clear method (2 of 2)

Removes all external links.

```csharp
public void Clear(bool updateReferencesAsLocal)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| updateReferencesAsLocal | Boolean | Whether update all references of external links as references of current workbook itself. |

### Remarks

If references are required to be updated, references to external links in formulas will be changed to current workbook. For example, one cell's original formula is "='externalsource.xlam'!customfunction()", after removing external links, the formula will become "=customfunction()". If references are not required to be updated, all formulas with references to external links will be removed too because those references become invalid.
