## ReferredArea.SheetName property

Indicates which sheet this reference is in.

```csharp
public string SheetName { get; }
```

### Remarks

If it references to multiple worksheets, the returned value is just like the range expression in the formula. For example "Sheet1:Sheet3" for the reference in formula "=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet3!$A$1:$B$2)".
