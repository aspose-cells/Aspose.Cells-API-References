## Row.GetCellByIndex method

Get the cell by specific index in the cells collection of this row.

```csharp
public Cell GetCellByIndex(int index)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| index | Int32 | The index(position) of the cell in the cells collection of this row. |

### Return Value

The Cell object at given position.

### Remarks

To traverse all cells in sequence without modification, using [`GetEnumerator`](../getenumerator/) will give better performance than using this method to get cell one by one.
