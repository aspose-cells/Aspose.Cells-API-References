## Worksheet.CustomProperties property

Gets an object representing the identifier information associated with a worksheet.

```csharp
public CustomPropertyCollection CustomProperties { get; }
```

### Remarks

Worksheet.CustomProperties provide a preferred mechanism for storing arbitrary data. It supports legacy third-party document components, as well as those situations that have a stringent need for binary parts.
