description: Indicates if a crosscell string will be displayed in the same way as MS Excel when saving an Excel file in html format. By default the value is Default so for crosscell strings there is little difference between the html files created by Aspose.Cells and MS Excel. But the performance for creating large html filessetting the value to Cross would be several times faster than setting it to Default or Fit2Cell.
