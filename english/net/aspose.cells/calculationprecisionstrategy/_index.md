## CalculationPrecisionStrategy enumeration

Enumerates strategies for handling calculation precision. Because of the precision issue of IEEE 754 Floating-Point Arithmetic, some "seemingly simple" formulas may not be calculated as the expected result. Such as formula "=-0.45+0.43+0.02", when calculating operands by '+' operator directly, the result is not zero. For such kind of precision issue, some special strategies may give the expected result.

```csharp
public enum CalculationPrecisionStrategy
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0` | No strategy applied on calculation. When calculating just use the original double value as operand and return the result directly. Most efficient for performance and applicable for most cases. |
| Round | `1` | Rounds the calculation result according with significant digits. |
| Decimal | `2` | Uses decimal as operands when possible. Most inefficient for performance. |

### Examples

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class CalculationPrecisionStrategyDemo
    {
        public static void CalculationPrecisionStrategyExample()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // Add a new worksheet to the workbook
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add sample data to the worksheet
            worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue("Formula");
            worksheet.Cells["A2"].Formula = "=-0.45+0.43+0.02"; // This should ideally equal 0

            // Set calculation options
            CalculationOptions calcOptions = new CalculationOptions
            {
                IgnoreError = true,
                Recursive = true,
                PrecisionStrategy = CalculationPrecisionStrategy.Round // Using Round strategy
            };

            // Calculate the formulas in the worksheet
            workbook.CalculateFormula(calcOptions);

            // Get the result of the formula
            double result = worksheet.Cells["A2"].DoubleValue;

            // Output the result
            Console.WriteLine("Calculated Result: " + result);

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("CalculationPrecisionStrategyExample.xlsx");
            workbook.Save("CalculationPrecisionStrategyExample.pdf");
        }
    }
}
```
