## Cells.MergedCells property

Gets the collection of merged cells.

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use Cells.GetMergedAreas() instead.")]
[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public ArrayList MergedCells { get; }
```

### Remarks

In this collection, each item is a [`CellArea`](../../cellarea/) structure which represents an area of merged cells.

NOTE: This method is now obsolete. Instead, please use Cells.GetMergedAreas() method. This method will be removed 12 months later since November 2023. Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
