## Cells.MaxDataColumn property

Maximum column index of cell which contains data.

```csharp
public int MaxDataColumn { get; }
```

### Remarks

-1 will be returned if there is no cell which contains data. This property needs to iterate and check all cells in a worksheet, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly.
