## FormulaSettings.CalculateOnOpen property

Indicates whether the application is required to perform a full calculation when the workbook is opened.

```csharp
public bool CalculateOnOpen { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This property is only for saving the settings to resultant spreadsheet file so that other applications(such as ms excel) may act accordingly when loading the resultant file. For performance consideration for most users' applications, we do not calculate any formula in the workbook automatically, no matter what value has been set for this property.

### Examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class FormulaSettingsPropertyCalculateOnOpenDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            // Access first worksheet
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
            
            // Set formula in cell A1 that references B1
            worksheet.Cells["A1"].Formula = "=B1";
            
            // Set value in cell B1
            worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(10);
            
            // Disable automatic formula calculation on open
            workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculateOnOpen = false;
            
            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("output.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
            
            // Reopen the saved workbook
            Workbook reopenedWorkbook = new Workbook("output.xlsx");
            
            // Verify formula wasn't calculated on open
            Console.WriteLine("A1 value (should be 0 before calculation): " + reopenedWorkbook.Worksheets[0].Cells["A1"].IntValue);
            
            // Calculate formulas manually
            reopenedWorkbook.CalculateFormula();
            
            // Verify formula was calculated
            Console.WriteLine("A1 value (should be 10 after calculation): " + reopenedWorkbook.Worksheets[0].Cells["A1"].IntValue);
        }
    }
}
```
