## FormulaSettings.CalculationMode property

Gets or sets the mode for workbook calculation in ms excel.

```csharp
public CalcModeType CalculationMode { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This property is only for saving the settings to resultant spreadsheet file so that other applications(such as ms excel) may act accordingly when loading and manipulating the resultant file. For performance consideration for most user's application, we do not calculate any formula in the workbook automatically, no matter what mode has been set for this property. If user needs to calculate formulas, please always call methods on different objects according to requirement: [`CalculateFormula`](../../workbook/calculateformula/), [`CalculateFormula`](../../worksheet/calculateformula/), [`Calculate`](../../cell/calculate/), ...etc.

### Examples

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class FormulaSettingsPropertyCalculationModeDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // Set calculation mode to AutomaticExceptTable
            workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode = CalcModeType.AutomaticExceptTable;
            Console.WriteLine("Calculation Mode: " + workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode);

            // Change calculation mode to Manual
            workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode = CalcModeType.Manual;
            Console.WriteLine("Calculation Mode: " + workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode);

            // Reset to default Automatic mode
            workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode = CalcModeType.Automatic;
            Console.WriteLine("Calculation Mode: " + workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.CalculationMode);
        }
    }
}
```
