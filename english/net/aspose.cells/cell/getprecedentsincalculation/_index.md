## Cell.GetPrecedentsInCalculation method

Gets all precedents(reference to cells in current workbook) used by this cell's formula while calculating it.

```csharp
public IEnumerator GetPrecedentsInCalculation()
```

### Return Value

Enumerator to enumerate all references(ReferredArea)

### Remarks

This method can only work with the situation that [`EnableCalculationChain`](../../formulasettings/enablecalculationchain) is true for the workbook and the workbook has been fully calculated. If this cell is not a formula or it does not reference to any other cells, null will be returned.

### Examples

```csharp
[C#]

Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Cells cells = workbook.Worksheets[0].Cells;
cells["A2"].Formula = "=IF(TRUE,B2,B1)";
workbook.Settings.FormulaSettings.EnableCalculationChain = true;
workbook.CalculateFormula();
IEnumerator en = cells["A2"].GetPrecedentsInCalculation();
Console.WriteLine("A2's calculation precedents:");
while(en.MoveNext())
{
    ReferredArea r = (ReferredArea)en.Current;
    Console.WriteLine(r);
}
```
