## Cell.GetDependentsInCalculation method

Gets all cells whose calculated result depends on this cell.

```csharp
public IEnumerator GetDependentsInCalculation(bool recursive)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| recursive | Boolean | Whether returns those dependents which do not reference to this cell directly but reference to other leafs of this cell |

### Return Value

Enumerator to enumerate all dependents(Cell)

### Remarks

This method can only work with the situation that [`EnableCalculationChain`](../../formulasettings/enablecalculationchain) is true for the workbook and the workbook has been fully calculated. If there is no formula reference to this cell, null will be returned.

### Examples

```csharp
[C#]

Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Cells cells = workbook.Worksheets[0].Cells;
cells["A1"].Formula = "=B1+SUM(B1:B10)+[Book1.xls]Sheet1!B2";
cells["A2"].Formula = "=IF(TRUE,B2,B1)";
IEnumerator en = cells["B1"].GetDependentsInCalculation();
while(en.MoveNext())
{
     Console.WriteLine(((Cell)en.Current).Name);
}
```
