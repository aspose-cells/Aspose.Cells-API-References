## AbstractCalculationEngine.ProcessBuiltInFunctions property

Whether built-in functions that have been supported by the built-in engine should be checked and processed by this implementation. Default is false.

```csharp
public virtual bool ProcessBuiltInFunctions { get; }
```

### Remarks

If user needs to change the calculation logic of some built-in functions, this property should be set as true. Otherwise please leave this property as false for performance consideration.
