## WorkbookSettings.ParsingFormulaOnOpen property

Indicates whether parsing the formula when reading the file.

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use LoadOptions.ParsingFormulaOnOpen instead.")]
[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public bool ParsingFormulaOnOpen { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Only applies for Excel Xlsx, Xltx, Xltm and Xlsm file because the formulas in the files are stored with a string formula. NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Instead, please use LoadOptions.ParsingFormulaOnOpen. This property will be removed 12 months later since January 2020. Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
