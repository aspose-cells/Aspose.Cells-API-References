## TxtLoadOptions.TreatQuotePrefixAsValue property

Indicates whether the leading single quote sign should be taken as part of the value of one cell. Default is true. If it is false, the leading single quote will be removed from corresponding cell's value and [`QuotePrefix`](../../style/quoteprefix) will be set as true for the cell.

```csharp
public bool TreatQuotePrefixAsValue { get; set; }
```
