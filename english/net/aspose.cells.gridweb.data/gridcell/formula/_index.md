## GridCell.Formula property

Gets or sets a formula of the [`GridCell`](../../gridcell).

### Remarks

A formula string always begins with an equal sign (=). And please always use comma(,) as parameters delimeter, such as "=SUM(A1, E1, H2)".

User can set any formula in Workbook designer file. Aspose.Cells will keep all the formulas. If user use this property to set a formula to a cell, major part of Workbook built-in functions is supported. And more is coming. If you have any special need for Workbook built-in functions, please let us know.

ridWorksheet sheet = GridWeb1.ActiveSheet;
heet.Cells["B6"].Formula = "=SUM(B2:B5, E1) + sheet1!A1";

[Visual Basic]

im GridWeb1 As GridWeb =  New GridWeb() 
im sheet As GridWorksheet =  GridWeb1.ActiveSheet
