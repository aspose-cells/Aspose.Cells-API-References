## WebQueryConnection class

Specifies the properties for a web query source. A web query will retrieve data from HTML tables, and can also supply HTTP "Get" parameters to be processed by the web server in generating the HTML by including the parameters and parameter elements.

```csharp
public class WebQueryConnection : ExternalConnection
```

## Properties

This URL is persisted in the case that sourceData="true" and url has been redirected to reference an XML file. Then the user-facing page can be shown in the UI, and the XML data can be retrieved behind the scenes. |

| [IsTextDates](istextdates) { get; set; } | Flag indicating whether dates should be imported into cells in the worksheet as text rather than dates. |
| [IsXl2000](isxl2000) { get; set; } | This flag exists for backward compatibility with older existing spreadsheet files, and is set to true if this web query was refreshed in a spreadsheet application newer than or equal to Microsoft Excel 2000. This is an optional attribute that can be ignored. |
| [IsXl97](isxl97) { get; set; } | This flag exists for backward compatibility with older existing spreadsheet files, and is set to true if this web query was created in Microsoft Excel 97. This is an optional attribute that can be ignored. |
| [IsXml](isxml) { get; set; } | true if the web query source is XML (versus HTML), otherwise false. |
| [IsXmlSourceData](isxmlsourcedata) { get; set; } | Flag indicating that XML source data should be imported instead of the HTML table itself. |
