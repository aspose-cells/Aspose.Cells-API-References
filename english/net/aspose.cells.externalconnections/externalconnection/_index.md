## ExternalConnection class

Specifies an external data connection

```csharp
public abstract class ExternalConnection
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BackgroundRefresh](backgroundrefresh) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the connection can be refreshed in the background (asynchronously). true if preferred usage of the connection is to refresh asynchronously in the background; false if preferred usage of the connection is to refresh synchronously in the foreground. |
| [ConnectionDescription](connectiondescription) { get; set; } | Specifies the user description for this connection |
| [ConnectionId](connectionid) { get; } | Specifies The unique identifier of this connection. |
| [CredentialsMethodType](credentialsmethodtype) { get; set; } | Specifies the authentication method to be used when establishing (or re-establishing) the connection. |
| [Id](id) { get; } | Gets the id of the connection. |
| [IsDeleted](isdeleted) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the associated workbook connection has been deleted. true if the connection has been deleted; otherwise, false. |
| [IsNew](isnew) { get; set; } | True if the connection has not been refreshed for the first time; otherwise, false. This state can happen when the user saves the file before a query has finished returning. |
| [KeepAlive](keepalive) { get; set; } | True when the spreadsheet application should make efforts to keep the connection open. When false, the application should close the connection after retrieving the information. |
| [Name](name) { get; set; } | Specifies the name of the connection. Each connection must have a unique name. |
| [OdcFile](odcfile) { get; set; } | Specifies the full path to external connection file from which this connection was created. If a connection fails during an attempt to refresh data, and reconnectionMethod=1, then the spreadsheet application will try again using information from the external connection file instead of the connection object embedded within the workbook. |
| [OnlyUseConnectionFile](onlyuseconnectionfile) { get; set; } | Indicates whether the spreadsheet application should always and only use the connection information in the external connection file indicated by the odcFile attribute when the connection is refreshed. If false, then the spreadsheet application should follow the procedure indicated by the reconnectionMethod attribute |
| [Parameters](parameters) { get; } | Gets [`ConnectionParameterCollection`](../connectionparametercollection) for an ODBC or web query. |
| virtual [PowerQueryFormula](powerqueryformula) { get; } | Gets the definition of power query formula. |
| [ReconnectionMethodType](reconnectionmethodtype) { get; set; } | Specifies what the spreadsheet application should do when a connection fails. The default value is ReConnectionMethodType.Required. |
| [RefreshInternal](refreshinternal) { get; set; } | Specifies the number of minutes between automatic refreshes of the connection. |
| [RefreshOnLoad](refreshonload) { get; set; } | True if this connection should be refreshed when opening the file; otherwise, false. |
| [SaveData](savedata) { get; set; } | True if the external data fetched over the connection to populate a table is to be saved with the workbook; otherwise, false. |
| [SavePassword](savepassword) { get; set; } | True if the password is to be saved as part of the connection string; otherwise, False. |
| [SourceFile](sourcefile) { get; set; } | Used when the external data source is file-based. When a connection to such a data source fails, the spreadsheet application attempts to connect directly to this file. May be expressed in URI or system-specific file path notation. |
| [SSOId](ssoid) { get; set; } | Identifier for Single Sign On (SSO) used for authentication between an intermediate spreadsheetML server and the external data source. |
| [Type](type) { get; set; } | Gets or Sets the external connection DataSource type. |
