## ExternalConnection.KeepAlive property

True when the spreadsheet application should make efforts to keep the connection open. When false, the application should close the connection after retrieving the information.

```csharp
public bool KeepAlive { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples.ExternalConnectionPropertyKeepAliveDemo
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;
    using System;

    public class ExternalConnectionPropertyKeepAliveDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            try
            {
                // Access the first external connection (assuming one exists)
                ExternalConnection connection = workbook.DataConnections[0];
                
                // Display the current KeepAlive value
                Console.WriteLine("Initial KeepAlive value: " + connection.KeepAlive);
                
                // Toggle the KeepAlive value since it's read-write
                connection.KeepAlive = !connection.KeepAlive;
                Console.WriteLine("Updated KeepAlive value: " + connection.KeepAlive);
                
                // Save the workbook with the modified connection settings
                workbook.Save("KeepAliveDemo.xlsx");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
