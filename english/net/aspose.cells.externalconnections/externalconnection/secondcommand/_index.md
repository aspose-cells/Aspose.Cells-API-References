## ExternalConnection.SecondCommand property

Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based page fields are in use. For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand), parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed

```csharp
public virtual string SecondCommand { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples.ExternalConnectionPropertySecondCommandDemo
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;
    using System;

    public class ExternalConnectionPropertySecondCommandDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            try
            {
                // Access the first external connection (assuming one exists)
                ExternalConnection connection = workbook.DataConnections[0];
                
                // Display the current SecondCommand value (read operation)
                Console.WriteLine("Initial SecondCommand value: " + connection.SecondCommand);
                
                // Set a new SecondCommand value (since it's read-write)
                connection.SecondCommand = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA'";
                Console.WriteLine("Updated SecondCommand value: " + connection.SecondCommand);
                
                // Clear the SecondCommand to demonstrate setting empty string
                connection.SecondCommand = string.Empty;
                Console.WriteLine("Cleared SecondCommand value: " + connection.SecondCommand);
                
                // Save the workbook with the modified connection settings
                workbook.Save("SecondCommandDemo.xlsx");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
