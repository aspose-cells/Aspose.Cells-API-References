## ExternalConnection.SourceFile property

Used when the external data source is file-based. When a connection to such a data source fails, the spreadsheet application attempts to connect directly to this file. May be expressed in URI or system-specific file path notation.

```csharp
public string SourceFile { get; set; }
```
