## ExternalConnection.OdcFile property

Specifies the full path to external connection file from which this connection was created. If a connection fails during an attempt to refresh data, and reconnectionMethod=1, then the spreadsheet application will try again using information from the external connection file instead of the connection object embedded within the workbook.

```csharp
public string OdcFile { get; set; }
```
