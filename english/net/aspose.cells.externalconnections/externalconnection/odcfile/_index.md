## ExternalConnection.OdcFile property

Specifies the full path to external connection file from which this connection was created. If a connection fails during an attempt to refresh data, and reconnectionMethod=1, then the spreadsheet application will try again using information from the external connection file instead of the connection object embedded within the workbook.

```csharp
public string OdcFile { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples.ExternalConnectionPropertyOdcFileDemo
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;
    using System;

    public class ExternalConnectionPropertyOdcFileDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            try
            {
                // Access the first external connection (assuming one exists)
                ExternalConnection connection = workbook.DataConnections[0];
                
                // Display the current OdcFile value
                Console.WriteLine("Initial OdcFile value: " + connection.OdcFile);
                
                // Set a new OdcFile value (since it's read-write)
                connection.OdcFile = @"C:\Connections\ExternalData.odc";
                Console.WriteLine("Updated OdcFile value: " + connection.OdcFile);
                
                // Clear the OdcFile value
                connection.OdcFile = string.Empty;
                Console.WriteLine("Cleared OdcFile value: " + connection.OdcFile);
                
                // Save the workbook with the modified connection settings
                workbook.Save("OdcFileDemo.xlsx");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
