## ExternalConnection.IsNew property

True if the connection has not been refreshed for the first time; otherwise, false. This state can happen when the user saves the file before a query has finished returning.

```csharp
public bool IsNew { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples.ExternalConnectionPropertyIsNewDemo
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;
    using System;

    public class ExternalConnectionPropertyIsNewDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            try
            {
                // Access the first external connection (newly created connections are typically "IsNew")
                ExternalConnection connection = workbook.DataConnections[0];
                
                // Display the initial IsNew value
                Console.WriteLine("Initial IsNew value: " + connection.IsNew);
                
                // Since IsNew is read-write, demonstrate setting it
                connection.IsNew = false;
                Console.WriteLine("Updated IsNew value: " + connection.IsNew);
                
                // Save the workbook with the modified connection settings
                workbook.Save("IsNewDemo.xlsx");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
