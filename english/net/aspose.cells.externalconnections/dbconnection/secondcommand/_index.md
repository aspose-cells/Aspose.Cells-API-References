## DBConnection.SecondCommand property

Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based page fields are in use. For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand), parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed

```csharp
public override string SecondCommand { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples.DBConnectionPropertySecondCommandDemo
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;
    using System;

    public class DBConnectionPropertySecondCommandDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            
            try
            {
                // Create a new DBConnection instance by adding it to the collection
                var connections = workbook.DataConnections;
                DBConnection dbConnection = (DBConnection)connections[0];
                
                // Set up a basic connection
                dbConnection.ConnectionString = "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;";
                dbConnection.CommandType = OLEDBCommandType.SqlStatement;
                dbConnection.Command = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA'";
                
                // Set and demonstrate the SecondCommand property
                dbConnection.SecondCommand = "SELECT * FROM Customers";
                Console.WriteLine("SecondCommand value: " + dbConnection.SecondCommand);
                
                // Modify the SecondCommand to show it's writable
                dbConnection.SecondCommand = "SELECT * FROM Orders";
                Console.WriteLine("Updated SecondCommand value: " + dbConnection.SecondCommand);
                
                // Save the workbook
                workbook.Save("SecondCommandDemo.xlsx");
                
                Console.WriteLine("SecondCommand demonstration completed successfully.");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
