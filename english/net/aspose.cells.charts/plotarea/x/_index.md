## PlotArea.X property

Gets or gets the x coordinate of the upper left corner of plot-area bounding box in units of 1/4000 of the chart area.

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use PlotArea.XRatioToChart property, instead.")]
[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public override int X { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The plot-area bounding box includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If the value is not created by MS Excel, please call Chart.Calculate() method before calling this method.

The **X**, **Y**, **Width** and **Height** of **PlotArea** represents the plot-area bounding box that includes the plot area, tick marks(tick labels), and a small border around the tick marks. If you want to get actual size of plot area, you should call **InnerXRatioToChart**, **InnerYRatioToChart**, **InnerWidthRatioToChart** and **InnerHeightRatioToChart** properties.

For excel 2007 or latter, the default value is zero. you should call get the value after calling Chart.Calculate().

NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use PlotArea.XRatioToChart property, instead. X = XRatioToChart * 4000. This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
