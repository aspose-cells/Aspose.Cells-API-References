## TickLabels.Offset property

Gets and sets the distance of labels from the axis.

```csharp
public int Offset { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default distance is 100 percent, which represents the default spacing between the axis labels and the axis line. The value can be an integer percentage from 0 through 1000, relative to the axis label’s font size.
