## PdfSecurityOptions.FullQualityPrintPermission property

Indicates whether to allow to print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be generated.

```csharp
public bool FullQualityPrintPermission { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When it is clear (and [`PrintPermission`](../printpermission/) is set), printing is limited to a low level representation of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality.
