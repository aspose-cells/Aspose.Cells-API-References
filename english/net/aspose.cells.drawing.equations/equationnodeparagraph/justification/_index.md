description: EquationNodeParagraph property. This specifies justification of the math paragraph a series of adjacent equations within the same paragraph. A math paragraph can be Left Justified Right Justified Centered or Centered as Group. By default the math paragraph is Centered as Group. This means that the equations can be aligned with respect to each other but the entire group of equations is centered as a whole

## EquationNodeParagraph.Justification property

This specifies justification of the math paragraph (a series of adjacent equations within the same paragraph). A math paragraph can be Left Justified, Right Justified, Centered, or Centered as Group. By default, the math paragraph is Centered as Group. This means that the equations can be aligned with respect to each other, but the entire group of equations is centered as a whole.

```csharp
public EquationHorizontalJustificationType Justification { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
    using Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Equations;
    using System;

    public class EquationNodeParagraphPropertyJustificationDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Create a shape to hold the equation
            var shape = worksheet.Shapes.AddTextBox(0, 0, 200, 50, 200, 50);

            // Get the equation paragraph
            var equationParagraph = shape.GetEquationParagraph() as EquationNodeParagraph;

            // Display current justification value
            Console.WriteLine("Current Justification value: " + equationParagraph.Justification);

            // Set different justification values and observe effects
            equationParagraph.Justification = EquationHorizontalJustificationType.Left;
            Console.WriteLine("Set to Left justification");

            equationParagraph.Justification = EquationHorizontalJustificationType.Center;
            Console.WriteLine("Set to Center justification");

            equationParagraph.Justification = EquationHorizontalJustificationType.CenterGroup;
            Console.WriteLine("Set to CenterGroup justification");

            equationParagraph.Justification = EquationHorizontalJustificationType.Right;
            Console.WriteLine("Set to Right justification");

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("EquationJustificationDemo.xlsx");
        }
    }
}
```
