## SplitPartInfo.PartIndex property

Index of current part in sequence(0 based). -1 means there are no multiple parts so the result is single.

```csharp
public int PartIndex { get; }
```

### Remarks

If multiple sheets need to be processed and every sheet is processed(split) separately, the part index always starts from 0 for every sheet. For example, when converting workbook to images, it represents the output page index of currently processed sheet. And -1 denotes there is only one page for current sheet.
