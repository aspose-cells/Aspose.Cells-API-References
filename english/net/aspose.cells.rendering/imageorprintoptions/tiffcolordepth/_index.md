## ImageOrPrintOptions.TiffColorDepth property

Gets or sets bit depth to apply only when saving pages to the `Tiff` format.

```csharp
public ColorDepth TiffColorDepth { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Has effect only when saving to TIFF. If TiffCompression is set to CCITT3, CCITT4, this will not take effect, the bit depth of the generated tiff image will be always 1.
