## Area.InvertIfNegative property

If the property is true and the value of chart point is a negative number, the foreground color and background color will be exchanged.

```csharp
public bool InvertIfNegative { get; set; }
```

### Examples

```csharp

[C#]

//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int sheetIndex = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[sheetIndex];
//Adding a sample value to "A1" cell
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
//Adding a sample value to "A2" cell
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(-100);
//Adding a sample value to "A3" cell
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
//Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(ChartType.Column, 5, 0, 15, 5);
//Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];
//Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "A3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:A3", true);
chart.NSeries[0].Area.InvertIfNegative = true;
//Setting the foreground color of the 1st NSeries area
chart.NSeries[0].Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
//Setting the background color of the 1st NSeries area.
//The displayed area color of second chart point will be the background color.
chart.NSeries[0].Area.BackgroundColor = Color.Yellow;
//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save("book1.xls");
