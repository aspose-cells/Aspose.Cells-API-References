## ShapeSegmentPath class

Represents a segment path in a path of the freeform.

```csharp
public class ShapeSegmentPath
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Points](../../aspose.cells.drawing/shapesegmentpath/points/) { get; } | Gets the points in path segment |
| [Type](../../aspose.cells.drawing/shapesegmentpath/type/) { get; } | Gets the path segment type |

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
    using System;

    public class DrawingClassShapeSegmentPathDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add a freeform shape to the worksheet
            Shape shape = worksheet.Shapes.AddFreeform(0, 0, 0, 0, 200, 200, new ShapePath[] { new ShapePath() });

            // Get the geometry path of the shape
            CustomGeometry geometry = shape.Geometry as CustomGeometry;
            ShapePath shapePath = geometry.Paths[0];

            // Access the first segment path (if exists)
            if (shapePath.PathSegementList.Count > 0)
            {
                ShapeSegmentPath segmentPath = shapePath.PathSegementList[0];

                // Demonstrate properties of ShapeSegmentPath
                Console.WriteLine("Segment Path Type: " + segmentPath.Type);
                Console.WriteLine("Number of Points: " + segmentPath.Points.Count);

                // Iterate through points in the segment path
                foreach (ShapePathPoint point in segmentPath.Points)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Point coordinates: X={point.X}, Y={point.Y}");
                }
            }

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("ShapeSegmentPathDemo.xlsx");
        }
    }
}
```
