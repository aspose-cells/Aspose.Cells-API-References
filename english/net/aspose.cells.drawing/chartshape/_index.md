```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Chart](chart) { get; } | Returns a Chart object that represents the chart contained in the object. |

### Examples

```csharp

[C#]

//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Obtaining the reference of the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Adding a sample value to "A1" cell
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);

//Adding a sample value to "A2" cell
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);

//Adding a sample value to "A3" cell
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);

//Adding a sample value to "B1" cell
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(60);

//Adding a sample value to "B2" cell
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(32);

//Adding a sample value to "B3" cell
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);

//Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(ChartType.PieExploded, 5, 0, 25, 10);

//Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];

//Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B3", true);

//Show Data Labels 
chart.NSeries[0].DataLabels.ShowValue = true;

//Getting Chart Shape
ChartShape chartShape = chart.ChartObject;

//Set Lower Right Column
chartShape.LowerRightColumn = 10;

//Set LowerDeltaX
chartShape.LowerDeltaX = 1024;

//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save("book1.xls");
