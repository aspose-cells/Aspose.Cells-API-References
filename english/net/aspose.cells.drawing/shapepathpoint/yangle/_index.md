## ShapePathPoint.YAngle property

When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees.

```csharp
public int YAngle { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If this angle is the swing angle of an arc. This angle will specify how far angle-wise along the supposed cicle path the arc will be extended. The extension from the start angle will always be in the clockwise direction around the supposed circle.
