### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
    using System;

    public class ShapePathMethodMoveToWithSingleSingleDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            try
            {
                //Create a new shape path
                ShapePath shapePath = new ShapePath();

                // Move to starting point
                shapePath.MoveTo(10, 10);

                // Call LineTo method with (Single, Single) parameters
                shapePath.LineTo(50.5f, 10.5f);
                shapePath.LineTo(50.5f, 50.5f);
                shapePath.LineTo(10.5f, 50.5f);
                shapePath.Close();

                //add free form
                worksheet.Shapes.AddFreeform(1, 0, 1, 0, 300, 200, new ShapePath[] { shapePath });

                Console.WriteLine("MoveTo method executed successfully with parameters (Single, Single)");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error executing LineTo method: {ex.Message}");
            }
           
            
            // Save the result
            workbook.Save("ShapePathMethodMoveToWithSingleSingleDemo.xlsx");
        }
    }
}
