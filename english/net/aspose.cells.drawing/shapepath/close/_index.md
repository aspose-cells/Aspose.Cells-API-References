## ShapePath.Close method

Closes the current figure and starts a new figure. If the current figure contains a sequence of connected lines and curves, the method closes the loop by connecting a line from the endpoint to the starting point.

```csharp
public void Close()
```

### Examples

```csharp
namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    using Aspose.Cells;
    using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
    using System;

    public class ShapePathMethodCloseDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            try
            {
                //Create a new shape path
                ShapePath shapePath = new ShapePath();
                shapePath.MoveTo(60, 45);
                shapePath.ArcTo(25, 25, 0, 270);

                // Close the path 
                shapePath.Close();

                shapePath.MoveTo(60, 20);
                shapePath.LineTo(110, 70);
                shapePath.LineTo(125, 155.5f);
                shapePath.ArcTo(35.5f, 35.5f, 0, 270);

                // Close the path 
                shapePath.Close();

                //add free form
                worksheet.Shapes.AddFreeform(1, 0, 1, 0, 300, 200, new ShapePath[] { shapePath });

                Console.WriteLine("Close method called successfully to complete the shape path");
                
                // Save the workbook
                workbook.Save("ShapePathMethodCloseDemo.xlsx");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error calling Close method: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
