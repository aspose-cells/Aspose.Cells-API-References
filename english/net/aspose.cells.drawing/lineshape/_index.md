```csharp

[C#]

//Instantiate a new Workbook.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
 
//Get the first worksheet in the book.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
 
//Add a new line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line1 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 250);
 
//Set the line dash style
line1.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
 
//Set the placement.
line1.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
 
//Add another line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line2 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(7, 0, 1, 0, 85, 250);
 
//Set the line dash style.
line2.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.DashLongDash;
 
//Set the weight of the line.
line2.Line.Weight = 4;
 
//Set the placement.
line2.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
 
//Add the third line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line3 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(13, 0, 1, 0, 0, 250);
 
//Set the line dash style
line3.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
 
//Set the placement.
line3.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
 
//Make the gridlines invisible in the first worksheet.
workbook.Worksheets[0].IsGridlinesVisible = false;
 
//Save the excel file.
workbook.Save("tstlines.xls");
