{
    public class ShapePropertyZOrderPositionDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add three shapes to demonstrate ZOrder
            Shape shape1 = worksheet.Shapes.AddRectangle(10, 10, 100, 100, 0, 0);
            Shape shape2 = worksheet.Shapes.AddRectangle(50, 50, 100, 100, 0, 0);
            Shape shape3 = worksheet.Shapes.AddRectangle(90, 90, 100, 100, 0, 0);

            // Set ZOrder positions
            shape1.ZOrderPosition = 0;
            shape2.ZOrderPosition = 1;
            shape3.ZOrderPosition = 2;

            // Change ZOrder of shape3 to bring it to front
            shape3.ZOrderPosition = 0;

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("ShapeZOrderDemo.xlsx");
