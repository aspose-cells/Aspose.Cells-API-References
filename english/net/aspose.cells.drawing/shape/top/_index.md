## Shape.Top property

Represents the vertical offset of shape from its top row, in unit of pixels.

```csharp
public int Top { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If the shape is in the chart, represents the vertical offset of shape from its top border.

### Examples

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class ShapePropertyTopDemo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            // Add a rectangle shape
            Shape shape = worksheet.Shapes.AddRectangle(1, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100);

            // Set initial top position
            shape.Top = 50;
            Console.WriteLine("Initial Top position: " + shape.Top);

            // Modify top position if it equals 3 (demonstrating the test case logic)
            if (shape.Top == 3)
            {
                shape.Top = 1;
            }
            else
            {
                // For demonstration, set to 3 and then apply the test case logic
                shape.Top = 3;
                if (shape.Top == 3)
                {
                    shape.Top = 1;
                    Console.WriteLine("Modified Top position: " + shape.Top);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
