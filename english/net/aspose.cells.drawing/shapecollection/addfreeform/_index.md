## ShapeCollection.AddFreeform method

Adds a freeform shape to the worksheet.

```csharp
public Shape AddFreeform(int upperLeftRow, int top, int upperLeftColumn, int left, int height, 
    int width, ShapePath[] paths)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upperLeftRow | Int32 | Upper left row index. |
| top | Int32 | Represents the vertical offset of freeform shape from its left row, in unit of pixel. |
| upperLeftColumn | Int32 | Upper left column index. |
| left | Int32 | Represents the horizontal offset of freeform shape from its left column, in unit of pixel. |
| height | Int32 | Represents the height of freeform shape, in unit of pixel. |
| width | Int32 | Represents the width of freeform shape, in unit of pixel. |
| paths | ShapePath[] | Represents a user-defined path |

### Return Value

A freeform shape.

### Remarks

Notice: That the width and height in the parameters can be any positive integer values, not the total width and height of the ShapePath array specified by ’paths'. The relationship between them is a scale-fill relationship, that is, each ShapePath object will be scaled according to the width and height. Therefore, when there are multiple objects in the 'paths', each ShapePath object needs to be designed reasonably to meet expectations. When there is only one ShapePath object and there are no other requirements, passing the object's width and height as parameter values ​​is a good solution.

### Examples

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;

namespace AsposeCellsExamples
{
    public class ShapeCollectionMethodAddFreeformWithInt32Int32Int32Int32Int32Int32Demo
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
            ShapeCollection shapes = worksheet.Shapes;

            // Create custom figure paths
            ShapePath shapePath = new ShapePath();
            shapePath.MoveTo(60, 45);
            shapePath.ArcTo(25, 25, 0, 270);
            shapePath.Close();
            
            shapePath.MoveTo(60, 20);
            shapePath.LineTo(110, 70);
            shapePath.LineTo(125, 155.5f);
            shapePath.ArcTo(35.5f, 35.5f, 0, 270);
            shapePath.Close();
            
            shapePath.MoveTo(150, 45);
            shapePath.ArcTo(25, 25, 0, 270);
            
            ShapePath shapePath1 = new ShapePath();
            shapePath1.MoveTo(0, 0);
            shapePath1.CubicBezierTo(48.24997f, 0.6844f,
                                96.5f, -7.148871f,
                                130, 11.517795f);
            shapePath1.CubicBezierTo(163.5f, 30.18446f,
                                182.24997f, 75.351f,
                                201, 120.517795f);
            shapePath1.MoveTo(150, 80);
            shapePath1.ArcTo(25, 25, 0, 270);
            
            // Add freeform shape to worksheet
            shapes.AddFreeform(1, 0, 1, 0, 200, 200, new ShapePath[] { shapePath, shapePath1 });

            // Save the workbook
            workbook.Save("AddFreeformDemo.xlsx");
        }
    }
}
