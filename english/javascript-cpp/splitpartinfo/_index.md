## SplitPartInfo class

Represents the information of one input/output for multiple inputs/outputs, such as current page to be rendered when converting spreadsheet to image.

```javascript
class SplitPartInfo;
```


## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [partIndex](#partIndex--)| number | Readonly. Index of current part in sequence(0 based). -1 means there are no multiple parts so the result is single. |
| [sheetIndex](#sheetIndex--)| number | Readonly. Index of the sheet where current part is in. -1 denotes there is only one sheet. |
| [sheetName](#sheetName--)| string | Readonly. Name of the sheet where current part is in. |


### partIndex {#partIndex--}

Readonly. Index of current part in sequence(0 based). -1 means there are no multiple parts so the result is single.

```javascript
partIndex : number;
```


**Remarks**

If multiple sheets need to be processed and every sheet is processed(split) separately, the part index always starts from 0 for every sheet. For example, when converting workbook to images, it represents the output page index of currently processed sheet. And -1 denotes there is only one page for current sheet.

### sheetIndex {#sheetIndex--}

Readonly. Index of the sheet where current part is in. -1 denotes there is only one sheet.

```javascript
sheetIndex : number;
```


### sheetName {#sheetName--}

Readonly. Name of the sheet where current part is in.

```javascript
sheetName : string;
```


**Remarks**

May be null for some situations, such as when rendering the whole workbook to tiff image.
