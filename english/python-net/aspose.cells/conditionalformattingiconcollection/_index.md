| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/capacity) | Gets or sets the number of elements that the array list can contain. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [add(type, index)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/add/#IconSetType-int) | Adds [ConditionalFormattingIcon](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingicon) object. |
| [add(cficon)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/add/#ConditionalFormattingIcon) | Adds [ConditionalFormattingIcon](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingicon) object. |
| [copy_to(array)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/copy_to/#list) | Copies the entire array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the beginning of the target array list. |
| [copy_to(index, array, array_index, count)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/copy_to/#int-list-int-int) | Copies a range of elements from the array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the specified index of the target array list. |
| [index_of(item, index)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/index_of/#ConditionalFormattingIcon-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the specified index to the last element. |
| [index_of(item, index, count)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/index_of/#ConditionalFormattingIcon-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that starts at the specified index and contains the specified number of elements. |
| [last_index_of(item)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/last_index_of/#ConditionalFormattingIcon) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the entire array list. |
| [last_index_of(item, index)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/last_index_of/#ConditionalFormattingIcon-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the first element to the specified index. |
| [last_index_of(item, index, count)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/conditionalformattingiconcollection/last_index_of/#ConditionalFormattingIcon-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that contains the specified number of elements and ends at the specified index. |
