This conditional formatting rule displays a gradated
data bar in the range of cells.



The DataBar type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [axis_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/axis_color) | Gets the color of the axis for cells with conditional formatting as data bars. |
| [axis_position](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/axis_position) | Gets or sets the position of the axis of the data bars specified by a conditional formatting rule. |
| [bar_fill_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/bar_fill_type) | Gets or sets how a data bar is filled with color. |
| [direction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/direction) | Gets or sets the direction the databar is displayed. |
| [bar_border](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/bar_border) | Gets an object that specifies the border of a data bar. |
| [negative_bar_format](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/negative_bar_format) | Gets the NegativeBarFormat object associated with a data bar conditional formatting rule. |
| [min_cfvo](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/min_cfvo) | Get or set this DataBar's min value object.<br/>Cannot set null or CFValueObject with type FormatConditionValueType.Max to it. |
| [max_cfvo](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/databar/max_cfvo) | Get or set this DataBar's max value object.<br/>Cannot set null or CFValueObject with type FormatConditionValueType.Min to it. |
