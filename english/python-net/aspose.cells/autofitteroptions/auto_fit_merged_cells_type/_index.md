## auto_fit_merged_cells_type property


Gets and set the type of auto fitting row height of merged cells.

### Remarks 


Excel defaults to ignore merged cells when fitting the row height, so Aspose.Cells works as MS Excel default.
Please set this type to change the way of auto fitting row height of merged cells.
