## SeriesCollection class

Encapsulates a collection of [Series](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/series) objects.



The SeriesCollection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [category_data](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/category_data) | Gets or sets the range of category Axis values. <br/>It can be a range of cells (such as, "d1:e10"), <br/>or a sequence of values (such as,"{2,6,8,10}"). |
| [second_category_data](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/second_category_data) | Gets or sets the range of second category Axis values. <br/>It can be a range of cells (such as, "d1:e10"), <br/>or a sequence of values (such as,"{2,6,8,10}"). <br/>Only effects when some ASerieses plot on the second axis. |
| [is_color_varied](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/is_color_varied) | Represents if the color of points is varied. |
| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/seriescollection/capacity) |  |
