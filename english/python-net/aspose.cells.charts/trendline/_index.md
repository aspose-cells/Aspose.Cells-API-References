## Trendline class

Represents a trendline in a chart.



**Inheritance:** [Trendline](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline) → 
[Line](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/line)



The Trendline type exposes the following members:

| [begin_arrow_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/begin_arrow_width) | Specifies the width of the arrowhead for the begin of a line. |
| [end_arrow_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/end_arrow_width) | Specifies the width of the arrowhead for the end of a line. |
| [theme_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/theme_color) | Gets and sets the theme color. |
| [color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/color) | Represents the Color of the line. |
| [transparency](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/transparency) | Returns or sets the degree of transparency of the line as a value from 0.0 (opaque) through 1.0 (clear). |
| [style](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/style) | Represents the style of the line. |
| [weight](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/weight) | Gets or sets the [WeightType](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/weighttype) of the line. |
| [weight_pt](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/weight_pt) | Gets or sets the weight of the line in unit of points. |
| [weight_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/weight_px) | Gets or sets the weight of the line in unit of pixels. |
| [formatting_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/formatting_type) | Gets or sets format type. |
| [is_automatic_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_automatic_color) | Indicates whether the color of line is automatic assigned. |
| [is_visible](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_visible) | Represents whether the line is visible. |
| [is_auto](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_auto) | Indicates whether this line style is auto assigned. |
| [gradient_fill](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/gradient_fill) | Represents gradient fill. |
| [is_name_auto](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_name_auto) | Returns if Microsoft Excel automatically determines the name of the trendline. |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/type) | Returns the trendline type. |
| [name](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/name) | Returns the name of the trendline. |
| [order](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/order) | Returns or sets the trendline order (an integer greater than 1) when the trendline type is Polynomial. <br/>The order must be between 2 and 6. |
| [period](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/period) | Returns or sets the period for the moving-average trendline. |
| [forward](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/forward) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends forward.<br/>The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero. |
| [backward](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/backward) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends backward. <br/>The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero.<br/>If the chart type is column ,the number of periods must be between 0 and 0.5 |
| [display_equation](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/display_equation) | Represents if the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the R-squared value). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. |
| [display_r_squared](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/display_r_squared) | Represents if the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the equation). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. |
