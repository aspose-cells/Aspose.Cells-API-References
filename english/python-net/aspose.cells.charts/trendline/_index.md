| [is_automatic_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_automatic_color) |  |
| [is_visible](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_visible) |  |
| [is_auto](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_auto) |  |
| [gradient_fill](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/gradient_fill) |  |
| [is_name_auto](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/is_name_auto) | Returns if Microsoft Excel automatically determines the name of the trendline. |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/type) | Returns the trendline type. |
| [name](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/name) | Returns the name of the trendline. |
| [order](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/order) | Returns or sets the trendline order (an integer greater than 1) when the trendline type is Polynomial. <br/>The order must be between 2 and 6. |
| [period](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/period) | Returns or sets the period for the moving-average trendline. |
| [forward](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/forward) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends forward.<br/>The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero. |
| [backward](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/backward) | Returns or sets the number of periods (or units on a scatter chart) that the trendline extends backward. <br/>The number of periods must be greater than or equal to zero.<br/>If the chart type is column ,the number of periods must be between 0 and 0.5 |
| [display_equation](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/display_equation) | Represents if the equation for the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the R-squared value). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. |
| [display_r_squared](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/display_r_squared) | Represents if the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the equation). Setting this property to True automatically turns on data labels. |
| [intercept](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/intercept) | Returns or sets the point where the trendline crosses the value axis. |
| [data_labels](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/data_labels) | Represents the DataLabels object for the specified series. |
| [legend_entry](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline/legend_entry) | Gets the legend entry according to this trendline |
