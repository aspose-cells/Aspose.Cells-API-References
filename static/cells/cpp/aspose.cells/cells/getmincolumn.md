##Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinColumn method
'Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinColumn method. Minimum column index of those cells that have been instantiated in the collection(does not include the column where style is defined for the whole column but no cell has been instantiated in it) in C++.'
## Cells::GetMinColumn method
Minimum column index of those cells that have been instantiated in the collection(does not include the column where style is defined for the whole column but no cell has been instantiated in it).
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinColumn()
```
## Remarks
This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
