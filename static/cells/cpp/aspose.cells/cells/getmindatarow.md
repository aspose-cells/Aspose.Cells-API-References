##Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinDataRow method
'Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinDataRow method. Minimum row index of cell which contains data in C++.'
## Cells::GetMinDataRow method
Minimum row index of cell which contains data.
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMinDataRow()
```
## Remarks
Return -1 if there is no cell which contains data. This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
