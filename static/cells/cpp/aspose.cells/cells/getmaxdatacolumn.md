##Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxDataColumn method
'Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxDataColumn method. Maximum column index of cell which contains data in C++.'
## Cells::GetMaxDataColumn method
Maximum column index of cell which contains data.
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxDataColumn()
```
## Remarks
-1 will be returned if there is no cell which contains data. This property needs to iterate and check all cells in a worksheet dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
