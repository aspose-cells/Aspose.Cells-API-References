##Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxRow method
'Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxRow method. Maximum row index of cell which contains data or style in C++.'
## Cells::GetMaxRow method
Maximum row index of cell which contains data or style.
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Cells::GetMaxRow()
```
## Remarks
Return -1 if there is no cell which contains data or style in the worksheet. This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically, so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly, such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
