'Aspose::Cells::AbstractCalculationEngine::GetProcessBuiltInFunctions method. Whether built-in functions that have been supported by the built-in engine should be checked and processed by this implementation. Default is false in C++.'
## AbstractCalculationEngine::GetProcessBuiltInFunctions method
Whether built-in functions that have been supported by the built-in engine should be checked and processed by this implementation. Default is false.
