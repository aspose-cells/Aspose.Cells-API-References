##Aspose::Cells::AbstractInterruptMonitor::IsInterruptionRequested method
'Aspose::Cells::AbstractInterruptMonitor::IsInterruptionRequested method. Indicates whether interruption is requested for current operation. If true then current operation will be interrupted. Implementation should perform fast and efficient check here, otherwise it may become another bottleneck for the procedure in C++.'
