##Aspose::Cells::SystemTimeInterruptMonitor::StartMonitor method
'Aspose::Cells::SystemTimeInterruptMonitor::StartMonitor method. Starts the monitor with the specified time limit. The start time to calculate time cost is just when this method is called, so the procedure which needs to be monitored should be started just after this call in C++.'
## SystemTimeInterruptMonitor::StartMonitor method
Starts the monitor with the specified time limit. The start time to calculate time cost is just when this method is called, so the procedure which needs to be monitored should be started just after this call.
```cpp

```
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| msLimit | int32_t | time limit(ms) to require the interruption. |
