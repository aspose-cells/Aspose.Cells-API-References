##Aspose::Cells::OoxmlCompressionType enum
'Aspose::Cells::OoxmlCompressionType enum. The Ooxml compression type in C++.'
## OoxmlCompressionType enum
The Ooxml compression type.
```cpp
enum class OoxmlCompressionType
```
### Values
| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level1 | 1 | <br>The fastest but least effective compression. |
| Level2 | 2 | <br>A little slower, but better, than level 1. |
| Level3 | 3 | <br>A little slower, but better, than level 2. |
| Level4 | 4 | <br>A little slower, but better, than level 3. |
| Level5 | 5 | <br>A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. |
| Level6 | 6 | <br>A good balance of speed and compression efficiency. |
| Level7 | 7 | <br>Pretty good compression! |
| Level8 | 8 | <br>Better compression than Level7! |
| Level9 | 9 | <br>The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. This is also the slowest compression. |
