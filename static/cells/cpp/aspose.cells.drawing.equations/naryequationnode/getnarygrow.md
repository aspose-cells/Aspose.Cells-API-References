##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::GetNaryGrow method
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::GetNaryGrow method. This attribute specifies the growth property of n-ary operators at the document level. When off, n-ary operators such as integrals and summations do not grow to match the size of their operand height. When on, the n-ary operator grows vertically to match its operand height in C++.'
