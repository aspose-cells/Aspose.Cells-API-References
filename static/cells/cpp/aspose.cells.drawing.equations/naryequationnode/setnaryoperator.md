##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::SetNaryOperator method
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::SetNaryOperator method. an n-ary operator.e.g "∑". It is strongly recommended to use attribute NaryOperatorType to set n-ary operator. Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type in C++.'
## NaryEquationNode::SetNaryOperator(const U16String\&) method
an n-ary operator.e.g "∑". It is strongly recommended to use attribute NaryOperatorType to set n-ary operator. Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type.
```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::NaryEquationNode::SetNaryOperator(const U16String &value)
```
## Remarks
It should be noted that this property only accepts one character, and if multiple characters are passed in, only the first character is accepted.
