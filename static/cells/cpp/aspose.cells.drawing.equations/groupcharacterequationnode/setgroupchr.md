##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetGroupChr method
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetGroupChr method. Specifies a symbol(default U+23DF). It is strongly recommended to use attribute ChrType to set accent character. Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type in C++.'
## GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetGroupChr(const U16String\&) method
Specifies a symbol(default U+23DF). It is strongly recommended to use attribute ChrType to set accent character. Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type.
```cpp
void Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetGroupChr(const U16String &value)
```
## Remarks
It should be noted that this property only accepts one character, and if multiple characters are passed in, only the first character is accepted.
