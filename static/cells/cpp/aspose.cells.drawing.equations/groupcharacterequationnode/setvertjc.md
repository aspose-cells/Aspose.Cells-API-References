##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetVertJc method
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Equations::GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetVertJc method. This attribute, combined with pos of groupChrPr, specifies the vertical layout of the groupChr object. Where pos specifies the position of the grouping character, vertJc specifies the alignment of the object with respect to the baseline in C++.'
## GroupCharacterEquationNode::SetVertJc method
This attribute, combined with pos of groupChrPr, specifies the vertical layout of the groupChr object. Where pos specifies the position of the grouping character, vertJc specifies the alignment of the object with respect to the baseline.
