```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartFrame::GetWidth()
```
## Remarks
How to convert units of 1/4000 to pixels? Width In Pixels = Width * Chart.ChartObject.Height / 4000d;
NOTE: This member is now obsolete. Please use ChartFrame.WidthRatioToChart property, instead. Width = WidthRatioToChart * 4000; This property will be removed 12 months later since February 2025. **Aspose** apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
