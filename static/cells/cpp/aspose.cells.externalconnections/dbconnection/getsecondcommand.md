##Aspose::Cells::ExternalConnections::DBConnection::GetSecondCommand method
'Aspose::Cells::ExternalConnections::DBConnection::GetSecondCommand method. Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based page fields are in use. For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand), parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed in C++.'
