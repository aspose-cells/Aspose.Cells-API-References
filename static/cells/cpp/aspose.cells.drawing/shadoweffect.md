## Methods
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetAngle()](./getangle/) | Gets and sets the lighting angle. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 359.9 degrees. |
| [GetBlur()](./getblur/) | Gets and sets the blur of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 100 points. |
| [GetColor()](./getcolor/) | Gets and sets the color of the shadow. |
| [GetDistance()](./getdistance/) | Gets and sets the distance of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 200 points. |
| [GetPresetType()](./getpresettype/) | Gets and sets the preset shadow type of the shadow. |
| [GetSize()](./getsize/) | Gets and sets the size of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 2.0. Meaningless in inner shadow. |
| [GetTransparency()](./gettransparency/) | Gets and sets the degree of transparency of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0.0 (opaque) to 1.0 (clear). |
| [IsNull()](./isnull/) const | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. |
| explicit [operator bool()](./operator_bool/) const | operator bool() |
| [operator=(const ShadowEffect\& src)](./operator_asm/) | operator= |
| [SetAngle(double value)](./setangle/) | Gets and sets the lighting angle. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 359.9 degrees. |
| [SetBlur(double value)](./setblur/) | Gets and sets the blur of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 100 points. |
| [SetColor(const CellsColor\& value)](./setcolor/) | Gets and sets the color of the shadow. |
| [SetDistance(double value)](./setdistance/) | Gets and sets the distance of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 200 points. |
| [SetPresetType(PresetShadowType value)](./setpresettype/) | Gets and sets the preset shadow type of the shadow. |
| [SetSize(double value)](./setsize/) | Gets and sets the size of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 2.0. Meaningless in inner shadow. |
| [SetTransparency(double value)](./settransparency/) | Gets and sets the degree of transparency of the shadow. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0.0 (opaque) to 1.0 (clear). |
| [ShadowEffect(ShadowEffect_Impl* impl)](./shadoweffect/) | Constructs from an implementation object. |
| [ShadowEffect(const ShadowEffect\& src)](./shadoweffect/) | Copy constructor. |
| [~ShadowEffect()](./~shadoweffect/) | Destructor. |
