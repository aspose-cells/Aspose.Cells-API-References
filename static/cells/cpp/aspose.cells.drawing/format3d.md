##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Format3D class
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::Format3D class. This class specifies the 3D shape properties for a chart element or shape in C++.'
## Format3D class
This class specifies the 3D shape properties for a chart element or shape.
```cpp
class Format3D
```
## Methods
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Format3D(Format3D_Impl* impl)](./format3d/) | Constructs from an implementation object. |
| [Format3D(const Format3D\& src)](./format3d/) | Copy constructor. |
| [GetLightingAngle()](./getlightingangle/) | Gets and sets the lighting angle. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 359.9 degrees. |
| [GetSurfaceLightingType()](./getsurfacelightingtype/) | Gets and sets the lighting type which is to be applied to the scene of the shape. Default value is [LightRigType.ThreePoint](../lightrigtype/). |
| [GetSurfaceMaterialType()](./getsurfacematerialtype/) | Gets and sets the material type which is combined with the lighting properties to give the final look and feel of a shape. Default value is [PresetMaterialType.WarmMatte](../presetmaterialtype/). |
| [GetTopBevel()](./gettopbevel/) | Gets the [Bevel](../bevel/) object that holds the properties associated with defining a bevel on the top or front face of a shape. |
| [HasTopBevelData()](./hastopbeveldata/) | Indicates if the shape has top bevel data. |
| [IsNull()](./isnull/) const | Checks whether the implementation object is nullptr. |
| explicit [operator bool()](./operator_bool/) const | operator bool() |
| [operator=(const Format3D\& src)](./operator_asm/) | operator= |
| [SetLightingAngle(double value)](./setlightingangle/) | Gets and sets the lighting angle. [Range](../../aspose.cells/range/) from 0 to 359.9 degrees. |
| [SetSurfaceLightingType(LightRigType value)](./setsurfacelightingtype/) | Gets and sets the lighting type which is to be applied to the scene of the shape. Default value is [LightRigType.ThreePoint](../lightrigtype/). |
| [SetSurfaceMaterialType(PresetMaterialType value)](./setsurfacematerialtype/) | Gets and sets the material type which is combined with the lighting properties to give the final look and feel of a shape. Default value is [PresetMaterialType.WarmMatte](../presetmaterialtype/). |
| [~Format3D()](./~format3d/) | Destructor. |
## Fields
