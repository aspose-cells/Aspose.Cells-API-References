##Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePathPoint::GetYAngle method
'Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePathPoint::GetYAngle method. When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees in C++.'
## ShapePathPoint::GetYAngle method
When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees.
```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Cells::Drawing::ShapePathPoint::GetYAngle()
```
## Remarks
If this angle is the swing angle of an arc. This angle will specify how far angle-wise along the supposed cicle path the arc will be extended. The extension from the start angle will always be in the clockwise direction around the supposed circle.
