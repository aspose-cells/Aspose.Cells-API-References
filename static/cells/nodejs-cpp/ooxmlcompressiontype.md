## OoxmlCompressionType enumeration
The Ooxml compression type
### Values
| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level1 | `1` | The fastest but least effective compression. |
| Level2 | `2` | A little slower, but better, than level 1. |
| Level3 | `3` | A little slower, but better, than level 2. |
| Level4 | `4` | A little slower, but better, than level 3. |
| Level5 | `5` | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. |
| Level6 | `6` | A good balance of speed and compression efficiency. |
| Level7 | `7` | Pretty good compression! |
| Level8 | `8` | Better compression than Level7! |
| Level9 | `9` | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. This is also the slowest compression. |
