## OoxmlCompressionType enumeration
The Ooxml compression type
The OoxmlCompressionType type exposes the following members:
### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| LEVEL1 | The fastest but least effective compression. |
| LEVEL2 | A little slower, but better, than level 1. |
| LEVEL3 | A little slower, but better, than level 2. |
| LEVEL4 | A little slower, but better, than level 3. |
| LEVEL5 | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. |
| LEVEL6 | A good balance of speed and compression efficiency. |
| LEVEL7 | Pretty good compression! |
| LEVEL8 | Better compression than Level7! |
| LEVEL9 | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream.
